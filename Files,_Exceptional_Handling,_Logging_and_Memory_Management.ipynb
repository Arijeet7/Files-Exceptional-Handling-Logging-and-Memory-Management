        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- Python automatically handles memory management using reference counting and a garbage collector to free unused memory, so programmers don’t have to manually allocate or deallocate memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- Memory management is important in Python because it:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Prevents memory leaks by freeing unused objects, ensuring the program doesn't consume more memory than necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Optimizes performance by efficiently allocating and deallocating memory as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Maintains program stability by avoiding crashes or slowdowns caused by running out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Simplifies development by handling memory automatically, so programmers can focus on writing code without manual memory control.\n",

        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- Python’s garbage collection works mainly through reference counting plus a cyclic garbage collector:\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Reference Counting:**\n",
        "  Every object keeps track of how many references point to it. When the count drops to zero (no references), the memory is immediately freed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Cyclic Garbage Collector:**\n",
        "  Some objects reference each other forming cycles, so their reference counts never reach zero. Python’s cyclic GC periodically finds and cleans up these reference cycles to free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- The else block in Python exception handling runs only if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "  To execute code that should run when the try block succeeds without errors.\n",

        "\n",
        "  WARNING – An indication that something unexpected happened, or a potential problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ERROR – A serious problem that caused part of the program to fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "  CRITICAL – A very serious error that may prevent the program from continuing.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:-\n",
        "**os.fork():** Creates a new child process by duplicating the current process at the OS level (available on Unix/Linux). The child is an almost exact copy of the parent. It’s a low-level system call.\n",
        "\n",
        "**multiprocessing module:** A high-level Python API to create and manage separate processes, providing better cross-platform support (works on Windows, macOS, Linux) and tools like process pools, queues, and shared memory.\n",

        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- The importance of closing a file in Python is to:\n",
        "  Free system resources like file handles that are limited and shared by the OS.\n",
        "  Ensure data is properly saved by flushing any buffered output to the file.\n",
        "  Avoid file corruption or data loss by properly ending file operations.\n",
        "  Prevent potential errors when other programs or parts of your code try to access the file.\n",

        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- **file.read()** reads the entire content of the file (or a specified number of bytes) as a single string.\n",
        "\n",
        "**file.readline()** reads one line at a time from the file, returning a single line as a string.\n",

        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:- The common challenges associated with memory management in Python are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Reference Cycles**\n",
        "  Objects referencing each other can create cycles that the reference counting system alone can’t clean up, requiring the garbage collector to handle them.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Memory Leaks**\n",
        "  If objects are unintentionally kept alive (e.g., through global references or caches), memory usage can grow unnecessarily.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Unpredictable Garbage Collection**\n",
        "  Garbage collection runs periodically and can introduce pauses, which may affect performance in time-sensitive applications.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Large Objects and Fragmentation**\n",
        "  Managing large data structures or many small objects can lead to memory fragmentation and inefficient memory use.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  **Limited Control**\n",
        "  Python’s automatic memory management means developers have less control over when exactly memory is freed, which can be problematic in some low-level or real-time systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "  **Better responsiveness** — programs (like GUIs) stay responsive while performing background tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Improved performance** for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file reading, network calls) by running multiple threads that wait without blocking the whole program.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Efficient resource** use by sharing memory between threads within the same process.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Simpler design** for tasks that can run concurrently without needing separate processes."
